API-Challenge

Created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. I have  utilized a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

I have created and analysed a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
